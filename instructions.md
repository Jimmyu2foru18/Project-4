   - Create HTTP response builder
   - Handle file operations
   - Add error handling (404, 500, etc.)

3. **Threading & Performance (Days 5-6)**
   - Add thread pool implementation
   - Implement connection handling
   - Add timeout management
   - Basic performance optimizations

4. **Integration & Testing (Day 7)**

   - Bug fixes

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (5 days)

1. **HTTP/1.1 Features (Days 1-3)**
   - Implement persistent connections
   - Add keep-alive support
   - Enable request pipelining

2. **Optimization & Robustness (Days 4-5)**
   - Add connection pooling
   - Implement proper resource cleanup
   - Add logging and monitoring
   - Performance tuning

---

## Phase 4: Documentation & Delivery (3 days)

1. **Documentation (Days 1-2)**
   - Code documentation
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Performance metrics

2. **Final Review & Submission (Day 3)**
   - Code review
   - Final testing
   - Package submission
   - Demo preparation

---

## Key Improvements:

1. **Reduced Preparation Time**: Condensed from 3 to 2 days by combining related tasks
2. **Parallel Development**: Server and client development happens simultaneously
3. **Earlier Integration**: Testing starts earlier in the process
4. **Focused Phases**: Each phase has clear, measurable deliverables
5. **Built-in Quality**: Testing and documentation integrated throughout

## Milestones

- **Day 2:** Complete design and setup
- **Day 9:** Working basic server and client
- **Day 14:** HTTP/1.1 features complete
- **Day 17:** Project delivery

## Success Metrics

- All HTTP/1.0 features working correctly
- Successful handling of concurrent requests
- Response time under 100ms for static files
- Zero memory leaks
- 80%+ test coverage
